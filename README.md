# Constrained-based graphic design

This is a basic implementation of the ideas presented by Anish Athalye under the name Basalt in his [article](https://www.anishathalye.com/2019/12/12/constraint-based-graphic-design/).
The repository includes a Z3-based solver as well as a custom autograd implementation for the gradient descent solver.
The Jupyter notebooks include examples of how to use the API.
Note that this project is still very much incomplete.
